I'm starting this blog as a way to post tutorial series on Makam, plus random thoughts.
I'm thinking of one series for programmers who want to learn more
about programming language theory, type systems, formal semantics, etc.; and another
one for programming language researchers who would like to use Makam to experiment
with new type system ideas.

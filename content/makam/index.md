title: Makam
---

Makam is a metalanguage: a language for implementing languages. It supports
consise declarative definitions, aimed at allowing rapid prototyping and experimentation
with new programming language research ideas. The design of Makam is based on higher-order logic
programming and is a refinement of the Î»Prolog language. Makam is implemented from scratch in OCaml.

The name comes from the makam/maqam of traditional Turkish and Arabic music: a set of
techniques of improvisation, defining the pitches, patterns and development of a piece of music.

I started working on the design and implementation of Makam started in 2012 at MIT, under the
supervision of [Prof. Adam Chlipala](http://adam.chlipala.net/), and continue to work on it as a
personal project at [Originate NYC](http://www.originate.com/).

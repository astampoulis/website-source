I am a software engineer and programming languages researcher living in New York City.
I work at [Originate NYC](http://www.originate.com/). I was previously at MIT and Yale.
You can view new posts to this site in a [blog format](blog).

# Research

* [Makam](makam) is a meta-language that I started working on during my post-doc at MIT,
and which I continue to work on during my [20% time at Originate](http://originate.com/20-percent-time).
It is cool, you should check it out.

* [VeriML](veriml) is the language I designed and built during my Ph.D.

* I've also worked on [SLAM](slam) with Microsoft Research, and [Karooma](karooma), a language
  for my undegrad thesis.

# Others

* I enjoy teaching and had the pleasure of TAing in various courses while at Yale -- Introduction to
Programming, Computer Networks, Formal Semantics and Computational Linguistics.

* I've been programming for a long time. You can find some of my [old projects](oldprojects).

* For official purposes, my name is Antonios Michael Stampoulis; for all other purposes, I prefer
the informal version of my first name, Antonis. In Greek, my name is written as Αντώνης Σταμπούλης.

Below you can find some old projects of mine.

- enRay ([source](enray-source.tar.gz), [Linux](enray-linux.tar.gz),
    [Windows](enray-windows.zip)), a realtime raytracing engine with
    hardware acceleration (programmed for first-generation
    fixed-pipeline accelerators). Example games with binaries for
    Windows and Linux: [enRay invaders](enray-invaders.zip),
    [enRay Tetris](enray-tetris.zip).
- [Tiger Compiler](compiler-tiger.tar.gz), for Zhong Shao's Compilers
    class, implemented in SML/NJ.
- [Haskell CSound wrapper with GADTs and arrows](music-hassound.tar.gz),
    for Paul Hudak's Haskell + Music course. Requires a working copy
    of Haskore.
- [Edsger Compiler](compiler-edsger.tar.bz2), for the Compilers course
    at the NTUA, implemented in C++. Compiles a subset of C into x86
    assembly and CIL code for .NET.
- Virtual Mechanics ([Windows](vmech-win.zip),
    [Linux i386](vmech-lin.tar.gz)), a simulator for elementary
    physics lab experiments. Developed with Alberto Angel, Melina
    Kourti, Panagiotis Voulgaris and Christos Dimoulas, for the
    software engineering course at the NTUA.
- [Connect Four](connect-four.zip), a network-enabled implementation
    of the popular board game in Java. Includes a powerful AI client.
- [Design and Implementation of a High-Level Language for Programming with Proofs](diploma-thesis.pdf),
    Diploma Thesis for the School of Electrical and Computer
    Engineering, NTUA, July 2006.
